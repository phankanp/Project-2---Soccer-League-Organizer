A tool to help a soccer league create teams, assign players to them fairly and then print out team rosters. Applied knowledge of arrays, sorting, the Java Collections Framework, and data structures.

# Steps

Teams can have a maximum of 11 players each.

- As an organizer, I should be presented with a menu item that allows me to create a new team, so that I can build the season.

Required fields are team name and coach.

- As an organizer, I should be presented with a menu item that allows me to add players to a team, so that I can build fair teams.
- As an organizer, I should be presented with a menu item that allows me to remove players from a team, so that I can attempt to produce more fair teams.
- As an organizer adding or removing a player to a yet to be chosen team, I should be prompted with an alphabetically ordered list of teams to choose from, so that I can quickly locate the team and avoid typos.
- As an organizer adding or removing a player to a chosen team, I should be prompted with an alphabetically ordered list of players along with their stats, so that I can quickly locate the player and take action.
- As an organizer planning teams, I should be able to view a report of a chosen team grouped by height, so that I can determine if teams are fair.
- As an organizer who is planning teams, I should be able to see a _League Balance Report_ for all teams in the league showing a total count of experienced players vs. inexperienced players, so I can determine from a high level if the teams are fairly balanced regarding previous experience.
- As a coach of a team, I should be able to print out a roster of all the players on my team, so that I can plan appropriately.

- As an administrator, I shouldn&#39;t be able to add more teams than there are available players so that teams can be arranged appropriately.
- As an administrator, I should only have the option of adding players that are not on existing teams, so that I don&#39;t accidentally put the player on two teams.
- As an administrator, my team report should show an average experience level so that we can try to manually balance fairness.
- As an administrator who is planning teams, the _League Balance Report_ should also include a count of how many players of each height are on each team.
